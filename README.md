# Investigation of Nash Q Learning in ZSMFGs

In the present project, we investigated the implementation of the Nash Q learning algorithm within the novel context of Zero-Sum Markov Games (ZSMFGs). While Nash Q learning has been examined in prior work on general-sum games, its potential in ZSMFGs remains unexplored. By bridging this gap, this project aims to expand the theoretical underpinnings and applications of Nash Q learning to adversarial multi-agent systems modeled as ZSMFGs. 

We tried Mean Field Type Nash Q learning and Nash-DQN in a 1D grid prey-predator game
